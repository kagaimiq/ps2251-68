# i8051

This is the MCU that runs the whole thing.

- 256 bytes (I)DATA (so the [rv51](https://github.com/cyrozap/rv51) is possible! That's what I've doing there too.)
- runs at 60 MHz?? (or whatever.. unless the timers doesn't run at 1/12)

## Memory map

*Note:* this is true at least when we're running the ISP/etc binary (loaded over the "2268 PRAM" USB device)

### CODE

- 0x0000-0x3FFF = ROM (seems to be bigger than 16k)
- 0x4000-0xFFFF = SRAM (offset 0x0000)

### XDATA

- 0x0000-0x5FFF = SRAM (offset 0x6000)
  * However, areas at 0x2000-0x203F and 0x2100-0x213F appear XORed with 0xff from the CODE's perspective
- 0x6000-0xDFFF = ? something..
  * either filled with `06 D0 07 0C BC 00 09 0D`, `01 F0 80 89 22 EC 20 E7` or something else
- 0xE000-0xEFFF = ?
  * filled with 0xFF with NAND (I think)
  * or with random data otherwise (maybe a randomizer/whitener?) - wraps each 256 bytes
- 0xF000-0xFFFF = XFR

### SFRs and XFRs

- Look [here](regs.md)

## Interrupts

- IRQ0 = External int 0 (USB Interrupt 1)
- IRQ1 = Timer 0
- IRQ2 = External int 1 (USB Interrupt 2)
- IRQ3 = Timer 1
- IRQ4 = Serial (?)
- IRQ5 = Reserved
